## Introduction

We identify two major limitations in the existing studies on retinal vessel segmentation: (1) Most existing works are
restricted to one modality, i.e., the Color Fundus (CF). However, multi-modality retinal images are used every day in the study
of the retina and diagnosis of retinal diseases, and the study of vessel segmentation on other modalities is scarce; (2) Even
though a few works extended their experiments to new modalities such as the Multi-Color Scanning Laser Ophthalmoscopy (MC), these works still require fine-tuning a separate model for the new modality. In this work, we introduce the universal retinal vessel segmentation task and present a novel universal vessel segmentation model (URVSM) for multi-modality retinal images. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first modality-agnostic retinal vessel segmentation model, reflecting the real-world need for generalizable solutions in retinal vessel segmentation. We tested our model on numerous commonly-used retinal image modalities from various commonly-used imaging systems. For more details, please refer to our paper (links available above).

## Get Started

Recommended dependencies:
<pre>
python==3.9.18
torch==2.1.0
numpy==1.26.0
scikit-image==0.24.0
scikit-learn==1.3.0
opencv-python==4.8.1.78
torch-topological==0.1.7
pillow==10.0.1
</pre>

### To use the model to segment retinal vessels (output segmentation only): 
1. Create a new directory in data (recommended) and copy the images (any format PIL.Image supports reading, see dataloader.py for details) in the folder
<pre>
./data/dataset_name
</pre>

2. run
<pre>
python segment.py --datapath ./data/dataset_name --note note_name
</pre>

3. The results, by default are saved to
<pre>
./result/note_name/segmentation
</pre>

### To use the model and compute the segmentation scores (ground truth available)
1. Create a new directory in data (recommended) with two folders `image` and `label`, copy the raw images and ground truth segmentation into the two folders, respectively.
<pre>
-data
  -dataset_name
    -image
      -img_01.png
      -img_02.png
      ...
    -label
      -gt_01.png
      -gt_02.png
      ...
</pre>

2. run
<pre>
python evaluate.py --datapath ./data/dataset_name --note note_name
</pre>

3. The metrics are printed as output. The segmented images, by default are saved to
<pre>
./result/note_name/segmentation
</pre>

### Note
For your own retinal images, we recommend applying a circular mask (e.g., `./mask.png`) to the image before using our model. As our training images for the image translation model are all after masking and we find that on regular square image without masking sometimes it will generate some artifacts which can deteriorate the downstream segmentation quality.

### Training
For image translation, please refer to [CycleGAN](https://github.com/junyanz/pytorch-CycleGAN-and-pix2pix).

For topological segmentation, please refer to [SATLoss](https://github.com/JRC-VPLab/SATLoss).
